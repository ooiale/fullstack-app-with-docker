# Fullstack Application with Docker

This is a fullstack app created with the intention of learning how Docker works.

The idea behind Docker is to create a container where all the application and installation processes will be run. In a group with multiple developers, this is a good idea since it normalizes the packages and installations required for the app, minimizing the risk of an app working on one computer but not on another.

Debugging Docker bugs can be a nightmare, and it comes with its inconveniences, but it also has many pros. Containers are excellent for deploying apps to production, but from my experience and understanding, installing and preparing Docker for a development environment can lead to a lot of headaches.
